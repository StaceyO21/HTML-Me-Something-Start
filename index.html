               <h2>Akward to Awesome!</h2>
               <p>
                  Growing up I was athletic but never really applied myself. I played basketball and was decent but gave that up when I had to tryout to get on the team in middle school. In eighth grade, I did end up trying out for and making the cheerleading squad. It was fun but I was never coordinated enough to do a backhand spring. So, when all of my friends went to the high school tryouts, I decided to sit it out. From then on, I just blended into the background of high school. I was a frumpy kid who wore baggy clothes and was not popular but had popular friends, which explains my high school career.

                  When I graduated, I drifted from job to job until I met a boyfriend who was obsessed with professional wrestling. After spending numerous hours watching, I did start to enjoy it. Then I began to think, I could do it better. Famous last words, I guess. I had been offered the chance to train by a family friend. He trained at a gym in St. Louis and said they needed female wrestlers. So, I jumped at the chance. I began training and soon fell in love. After training for 6 months, I had my first match and <b><font color='green'>Stacey O'Brien</font></b> was born. It was terrible but everyone's first match was awful. I kept training and having as many matches as I could. A friend in the business was working for Harley Race's WLW and decided she was going to quit wrestling. So, she told Harley about me and I received a call asking if I would be interested in working a few shows for him. Obviously, no one ever says no to Harley Race, so, I was on his show the next month.

               <h3>The First Step to the Rest of My Life</h3>
            <p>
               To wrestle for Harley Race was a dream come true for me. Harley is a legend in our business, so it was an honor. It was one of my first matches for WLW that I ended up tearing my interior labrum and rotator cuff. I continued to wrestle through my injury but it just kept getting worse. I would be in the middle of a match and my shoulder would dislocate. I would be able to pop it back into the socket quickly and keep wrestling. As much as it hurt, I was not going to ruin this opportunity. Besides, it was paying off. I got the asked to come train at WLW's facility in Eldon, MO. and meet my, now, life-long best friend. I was training and wrestling with Ric Flair's son (RIP), Ricky Steamboat's Son, and Curt Hennig's Daughter. I was honing my skills and achieving my dreams, I was on cloud nine. Then, my shoulder started to dislocate getting dressed in the morning. It was at this point that I made the decision to prioritize my healing and scheduled the surgery. It was a long recovery but after nine months, I was healed and cleared to return to the ring.

               Coming back from an injury was exhilarating and scary at the same time. I was back in the ring doing what I loved but had to be extremely careful to make sure I did not do anything to reinjure my shoulder. Keeping that in mind, I decided I needed to keep things simple. After some time, I realized it was to much to continue to travel from St. Louis to Eldon, which is a six-hour round trip, to train every month. Taking a leap of faith, I decided to move to Eldon to train full-time. It was a blast! Our class of wrestlers became fast friends and the head trainer at the time ended up becoming my husband. It was what I would call the "Good 'ole days!" I would go on to become WLW Ladies Champion at least five times and would get to wrestle all over the country. Meeting legends and new friends along the way. I was even able to go with Harley to WrestleMania in 2015. Life was good!

               As things did, time went on and things changed. Friends stopped wrestling, we moved the WLW training school to Troy, MO., and I decided to stop wrestling. I was beat up, tired, and wrestling wasn't paying the bills. Wrestling and working a full-time job do not always work well together. After some thought, I hung up my boots wrestling my last match in 2019. Not knowing that a couple of months later, our boss and mentor, Harley Race, passed away. It was one of the hardest things I have ever been through. Through the years, he had become a father figure and dear friend. Before his passing, Harley had willed the wrestling company to my husband and I. Years before, wrestling for Harley's company was a dream come true, now, I was part owner. Every day, we think of Harley and ask ourselves "What would Harley do?" We want to make sure that we keep his love alive and teach the new generation how Harley would want them taught. They are big shoes to fill but we will do whatever it takes to make sure it is done.
